Projection is a different medium to TV and web.
Subsets of video, CG graphics, stills available for those platforms are appropriate.

This project provides tooling for the development of content for projection.

* debian linux based graphics stack
* Targets Raspberry PI
* Debian VM development environment
*

* Uses Wayland as display server to avoid X11 headers such as Xlib.h
* C++14
* ~1s compile time for changes to graphics code (note hareware specs)
* make + pkg-config workflow.
