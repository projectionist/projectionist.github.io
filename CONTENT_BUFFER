Projection is a different medium to TV and web.
Subsets of video, CG graphics, stills available for those platforms are appropriate.

This project provides tooling for the development of content for projection.

* debian linux based graphics stack
* Targets Raspberry PI
* Debian VM development environment
*

* Uses Wayland as display server to avoid X11 headers such as Xlib.h
* C++14
* ~1s compile time for changes to graphics code (note hareware specs)
* make + pkg-config workflow.

<p>
  Projectionist sets out to explore the use of projectors as a dedicated medium for CG art.
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
  The quality of a space is a function of it's lighting, decoration, furnishings and artwork.<br>
  Few technologies work solely to improve qualitative non-functional experiences.
  Components which few current technologies can relate to.<br>
  TVs have an awkward physical presence. Their content is output without regard for the space.<br>
  Wall art is static by nature.<br>
  A projector, with computing capability could create light-based augmentation of a wall or ceiling, respond to textures, surfaces, sound, light levels, time, or anything else that sensors can afford the artist to be able to program adjustments.
</p>

<p>
  Projection onto bare wall surfaces effects an augmentation of the existing
  textures and colors.<br>
  Content is design not to dominate or overwhelm a space, but to lift it in ambience.<br>
  Without a screen, the space can be returned to natural light when switched off.<br>
  Commodity hardware and a specifically built software stack provide a productive toolkit for the development of projections.<br>
</p>

Hardware advances in computing and projection technology make accessible the opportunity to experiment with projectors as a dedicated medium for CG art.

<h2>Projectors, Screens &amp; Spaces</h2>

<p>
  Projectors create an experience different from backlit screens.<br>
  Sometimes projectors are used to create a large display on a uniform white surface, where a large enough screen might do the same job. Sport, films, etcetera.<br>
  This isn’t about those applications.<br>
  A backlit screen is a hole in a space. The screen dominates the space.<br>
  When they’re switched off they’re a black hole.<br>
  When they’re switched on they emit light without sympathy for the space.<br>
  Projection onto bare wall surfaces, rather than a screen effects an augmentation of an existing space.<br>
  The projection lifts the texture of the space.<br>
</p>

<p>
  From tailoring to designer to commodity, establishing the right content for a space is like clothing or decorating.
</p>

<p>
  A lot of content that already exists could be repurposed for this medium, giving authors another way to sustain their work. Images from news articles, Flickr etc. Video, from Vimeo, YouTube, etc. And CG artwork which might have otherwise been wasted as a screen saver.<br>
  Content applicable to this use case might otherwise be confined to exhibitions or the web, where it is visited briefly in a forum defined by a third-party.
</p>

<p>
  Projections work without sound, but perhaps an audio stream is available for some content via an iPhone application or LAN webpage.
</p>

<h2>Control</h2>
<p>
  Other than choosing the content, the projectionist can adjust parameters such as speed, hue, contrast and brightness to best fit the content to the space.<br />
  This would be done via an app from another device such as a phone, leaving the projection intact.
</p>

<h2>Sensors &amp; Interaction</h2>
<p>
  Connecting other sensors could provide the projection with environmental feedback so that it can adjust itself to space in a way defined by the author.<br />
  Cameras could provide geometric feedback about the projection surface.<br/>
  Microphones might allow the art to respond to noise, or voice. The projection could change based on light levels, temperature or signals specific to the space such as head-count. A projection in a cafe might display differently depending on head count.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  A projection might expose parameters which can be mapped to sensors by the projectionist.
</p>
<p>
  Opportunities to design interactions with people in a space via a phone app.

  - space are static are or screens
  - projector technology + computing hardware advances allow accessible experimentation
  - no node on the internet represents a space
