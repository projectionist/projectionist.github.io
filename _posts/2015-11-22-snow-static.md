# Snow Static

```
repository: https://github.com/projectionist/snow.git
branch: production/snow-static
```
Point-based static-like effect.
Downward flow, per-particle speed.
Colour effects surroundings like reflection.
Application to a space could use a camera to adjust flake colour to environment.
