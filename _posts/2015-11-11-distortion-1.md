Colour distortion based on levels of green, to which the eye is particularly sensitive.
The [sample clip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1279136/projectionist/productions/distortion-1/IMG_0024.m4v) is a ~3hr video of Rotterdam from the north-west of the Erasmus bridge, looking south-west.

The video is loaded as a texture, the colours are sampled and snapped to pink or green distorions in the fragment shader.
