Projectionist uses projection as a new medium to explore a vocabulary of technology and art designed to augment reality.

## Art

By projecting onto wall or ceiling surfaces without a screen, content can be designed
to lift the texture of the room.

The focus on projects has mainly been on black and white.
Using white-only illumination avoids overwhelming the spaces existing colors.

In combination with additional sensors such as a microphone or light sensor or camera, the scene could be automatically
adjusted to the projected space, as defined by the artist.

Discovery of pleasing Projections comes by design, direction, trial and error.
The tools are designed to enable rapid feedback.

The <a href="/projections">projections</a> page show some example applications using video and CG.
While this page shows video renderings, the output is intended to be projected in realtime.
This allows for the output to be adjusted to be more sympathetic to the space automatically or by the projectionist using a mobile app.

## Technology

A set of open source tools facilitate fast iteration and deployment to a Raspberry PI.

A core design principle is to target commodity hardware with a productive toolset to allow rapid iteration and discovery.
As well as increasing accessibility, modest hardware and software specifications provide a simple yet capable enough starting point. Some of the more intriguing CG work exhibits technological artifacts. Delays in rendering caused by limited CPU power or pixelation, for example, are idiosyncratic. The graphics stack will also run on any Debian distribution with Open GL ES 2.0, so more capable platforms can be targeted just as easily.
