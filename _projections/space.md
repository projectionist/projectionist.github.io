This is a good starting point for a projection that uses a 3D scene.
Uses a projection mapping to create the nostalgic generated flying thorugh space effect.
Uses GLM to create MVP matrices.
Moves too fast for most spaces, the visual depth adds little to the experience.
Use of video scene depth as projections needs a great deal more experimentation; perhaps 3D is redundant for Projectionist.
