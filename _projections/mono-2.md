This projection quantizes pixels to monochrome values, decided by comparing brightness to a threshold.  
The [sample clip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1279136/projectionist/projections/mono-2/IMG_3290.m4v) used is an unstable scene, the threshold is fixed threshold and the projection relies on the input video for variation.
