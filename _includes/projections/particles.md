## Particle projections

This point-based projection is a branch of the [Snow](http://github.com/projectionist/snow) repository.

Increasing the particle count causes particles streams show visual artefacts of compution. Delays in CPU availability result in gaps between generated particles and pauses in motion.  
The effect is a more complex experience that what was designed.
